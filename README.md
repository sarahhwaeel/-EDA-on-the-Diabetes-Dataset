# Diabetes Data Analysis Project

## Overview

This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a diabetes dataset. It includes data cleaning, visualization, and statistical analysis to understand trends and patterns related to diabetes.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Diabetes Dataset from Kaggle. The dataset contains various health indicators and binary labels indicating the presence or absence of diabetes.

## Project Structure

- `(EDA)_on_the_Diabetes_Dataset.ipynb`: The main Jupyter notebook containing the analysis, including data loading, cleaning, visualization, and statistical analysis.
- `data/`:(https://www.kaggle.com/code/alexteboul/diabetes-health-indicators-dataset-notebook)
- `results/`: images/images
- ## Results

The analysis includes:
- **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values and preparing the data for analysis.
- **Correlation Heatmap:** Shows the relationships between different features in the dataset.
- **Pair Plot:** Visualizes the pairwise relationships between selected features and the diabetes label.
- **PCA Analysis:** Reduces the dimensionality of the dataset and visualizes the data in 2D space to identify patterns.

Key findings include insights into how features like BMI, Glucose levels, and Age relate to the likelihood of diabetes.
